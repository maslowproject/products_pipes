Hey this is Josh.

I wrote this quick example in about an hour and a half.

I highlighted my understanding of classes and some quick data retrieval using json files.

I know there's much more complicated scenarios but for the sake of time this is what I put together.

I've included a picture of my very rough class Diagram. My thought process was to map out the the basic data relations from my
job at SCGTS if I was in charge. Products are the base class. Pipes and accessories are extended from Products and can be related to each other one to many.

This code is more or less theoretical. No testing was done.
